### Description
FLEA-FLICR is an R Shiny app that is used to analyze FLIC and FLEA experiments in Drosophila. The app can be accessed via https://bigmonty12.shinyapps.io/FLEA-FLICR/ or deployed locally using RStudio (after pulling this repository).
### FLEA
The Rothenfluh lab developed the FLEA (Fly Liquid-food Electroshock Assay) as a way to measure internal motivation of Drosophila. For more details, see our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.942508v1).
### Notes
Note that in order to analyze a FLEA experiment, the Excel file with the data must first be converted to a .csv file.
